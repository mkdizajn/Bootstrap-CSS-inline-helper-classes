* Paddings and margins are predefined in this range:

    - 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 px (positive)
    - 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 -px (negative)
    - 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 % (percentage)

* Position classes are:

	- rel => position relative
	- ab => position absolute
	- abtr => position absolute top right
	- abtl => position absolute top left
	- abbr => position absolute bottom right
	- abbl => position absolute bottom left
